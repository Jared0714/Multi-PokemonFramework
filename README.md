# Multi-Pokémon Framework

<p><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg"/></p>

Multi-Pokémon Framework is Pokémon plugin that is developed by Jared0714 which is based off of Nanquitas' CTRPluginFramework. This plugin is a work in progress as well as a learning exercise.

## Installation
https://github.com/Jared0714/Multi-PokemonFramework/releases

Obviously, you must have Custom Firmware installed on your Nintendo 3DS running 11.14 firmware or higher, if you don't, then I'm afraid you cannot use this plugin at all. And of course, you'll need to use your brain.

The plugin file's destination will vary depending on your game: `/luma/plugins/<titleid>/<plugin>`

Before proceeding any further, you must ensure that you have the the correct version of the modified Luma. In this case, replace your current `boot.firm` file at the root of your SD card with the provided `boot.firm` file. After booting into Luma3DS, open the Rosalina menu (default button combo L+Down+Select) and scroll down to the `Plugin Loader` and press A to enable it. This only needs to be done once. After that, simply start the game. A blue flash on the top screen indicates that the plugin was found and loaded, and in order to open up the plugin menu, press Select.

## Credits
Without Nanqutas' CTRPluginFramework, this plugin wouldn't even be possible. Nonetheless, special thanks to AnalogMan151 and Hartie95 for their references and help, without them this plugin wouldn't be where it's at, and a special thanks to Kominost and Lukas for helping out with technical issues. Not to mention, old school pkmn collector1 for alpha testing, and the friendly people over on Discord for helping out. And I couldn't have done this without any of them!
