# Multi-Pokémon Framework
Multi-Pokémon Framework is a plugin developed by [Jared0714](https://github.com/Jared0714) that uses the CTRPluginFramework library from [The Pixellizer Group](https://gitlab.com/thepixellizeross). It supports both the 6th and 7th generations of the Nintendo 3DS Pokémon games. This plugin is a work in progress as well as a learning exercise.

## Installation
After installing the .zip file, copy and paste the contents to the root of your SD card. After booting into Luma3DS, open up the Rosalina menu by pressing L + Down + Select. Scroll down to Plugin Loader and press A to enable it. This only needs to be done once. After that, simply start the game. A blue flash on the top screen indicates that the plugin was found and loaded, and in order to open up the plugin menu, press Select in game (after the title screens).
